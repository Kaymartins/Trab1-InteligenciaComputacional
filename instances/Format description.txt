The first line contains the following data: 

	N H D

Where
	N 	= number of vertices + 2
	H	= number of extra hotels (total number of hotels excluding initial and final ones) 
	D	= number of trips

The second line contains:
 
	Tmax	= total tour length

The third line contains:

	Td	= trip length for each trip d

The remaining lines contain data about location and score:

	x y Si

Where
	x	= x coordinate 
	y	= y coordinate
	Si	= score

	the first line is the starting hotel
	the second line is the ending hotel
	the next "H" lines are the extra hotels
	the remaining lines (N-2) are the vertices
